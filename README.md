# Dewey 200s Converter (Dart)

## Overview

This is a Dart script for converting a single Dewey 23 number between 220 and 299 to the alternative Dewey 200s schema described in Dewey 23.

This Dart script is intended to be compiled to Javascript and then  used in a web page context and there is a sample HTML file to demonstrate that.

This code has been developed by the Winnetka-Northfield Public Library District.
